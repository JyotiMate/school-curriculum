# Reading the Docs

## Instructions

There are many tools that a web developer may need that are on the [MDN documentation for client-side tooling](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Understanding_client-side_tools/Overview). Select 3 tools not covered in the lesson, explain why a web developer would use it, and search for a tool that falls under this category and share its documentation. Do not use the same tool example on MDN docs.

## Rubric

**Selenium IDE**

Selenium is an umbrella project for a range of tools and libraries that enable and support the automation of web browsers.
IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is the tool you use to develop your Selenium test cases. It’s an easy-to-use Chrome and Firefox extension and is generally the most efficient way to develop test cases. It records the users’ actions in the browser for you, using existing Selenium commands, with parameters defined by the context of that element. This is not only a time-saver but also an excellent way of learning Selenium script syntax.

**Meteor**

Meteor is a full-stack JavaScript platform for developing modern web and mobile applications. Meteor includes a key set of technologies for building connected-client reactive applications, a build tool, and a curated set of packages from the Node.js and general JavaScript community.
•	Meteor allows you to develop in one language, JavaScript, in all environments: application server, web browser, and mobile device.
•	Meteor uses data on the wire, meaning the server sends data, not HTML, and the client renders it.
•	Meteor embraces the ecosystem, bringing the best parts of the extremely active JavaScript community to you in a careful and considered way.
•	Meteor provides full stack reactivity, allowing your UI to seamlessly reflect the true state of the world with minimal development effort.

**Twitter Bootstrap**
Twitter Bootstrap or simply Bootstrap is an open-source HTML, CSS and JavaScript Framework that is used in front-end web development. Bootstrap has an authoritative presence in the front-end development world with hundreds of thousands of websites including some really popular website built based on the framework.

Bootstrap is used to create mobile-first, responsive websites quickly and easily. What it means is that you can easily create a website that scales itself to the size of the viewport of the device a person is using (responsiveness) and the website design is primarily intended for the mobile devices and then built up to suit the larger viewport devices (mobile-first).
